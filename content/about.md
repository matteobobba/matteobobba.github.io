I am a **Professor of Economics** at the [Toulouse School of Economics (TSE)](https://www.tse-fr.eu/) in France. My [academic research](/research) focuses on topics in **Development, Labor and Public Economics**. I am also interested in methodological aspects of **Policy Evaluation**, and in particular in combining model-based and design-based approaches.
