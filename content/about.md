I am currently a [Professor of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/people/matteo-bobba) at the [Toulouse School of Economics (TSE)](https://www.tse-fr.eu/). Prior to my academic career, I have been an Economist at the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en/knowledge-resources/research-idb) in Washington DC. 

I can be reached at [matteo.bobba@tse-fr.eu](mailto:matteo.bobba@tse-fr.eu). For information about my teaching activities, including current and past courses, please check my dedicated [TSE webpage](https://www.tse-fr.eu/people/matteo-bobba?tab=teaching).

I am a Research Fellow at the CEPR ([Development](https://cepr.org/research/programme-areas/development-economics) and [Labor](https://cepr.org/research/programme-areas/labour-economics)), [IZA](https://www.iza.org/person/6066/matteo-bobba), and the [EUDN](http://eudn.eu/?page_id=598). I am also an invited researcher at JPAL ([Learning for All Initiative](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/initiative/learning-all-initiative) and [Latin America Office](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/latin-america-caribbean)).

My research revolves around issues on the spatial distribution of **human capital** and the functioning of **labor markets** in **low and middle income countries**. I am also interested in methodological aspects of **policy evaluation**, and in particular in combining model-based and design-based approaches.
